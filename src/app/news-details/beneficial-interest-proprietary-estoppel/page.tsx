            Our client had lived in a family home for almost 20 years and
            transformed it into her dream residence. She invested tens of
            thousands of pounds in improvements, from a new kitchen and bathroom
            to landscaping and internal rewiring. Legally, the property was held
            in the names of her father and brother, both of whom had assured her
            on numerous occasions that the home would one day belong to her.
            When her father died and, a few years later, her brother also passed
            away, the beneficiaries of her late brother’s estate wrote demanding
            vacant possession or payment of £300,000, representing their 50 per
            cent share. High Court proceedings followed and that was the point
            at which we were instructed.

            Proprietary estoppel protects a person who has relied on a promise
            about rights in land and suffered a detriment as a result. There are
            four key elements:
          </Typography>
          <ol style={{ marginLeft: "30px", color: "#00000080" }}>
            <li>
              <Typography
                sx={{ mt: 1, color: "#00000080", fontSize: localFontSize.p2 }}
              >
                Assurance – A clear and unequivocal promise or representation
                about rights in the property.
              </Typography>
            </li>
            <li>

              >
                Reliance – The claimant acts on that assurance.

                sx={{ mt: 1, color: "#00000080", fontSize: localFontSize.p2 }}
              >
                Detriment – The claimant suffers a loss or detriment by acting
                on the promise.
              </Typography>
            </li>

                Unconscionability – It would be unjust or unfair for the legal
                owner to renege on the promise.
              </Typography>

            In our client’s case the assurances were explicit and repeated. She
            relied on them by moving in, treating the house as if it were her
            own and funding major renovations. She suffered a financial
            detriment by spending significant sums and foregoing other housing
            options. Finally, it would have been unconscionable for the
            beneficiaries to demand full market value after reneging on those
            promises.
          </Typography>

            Once a court establishes these elements it can order a remedy
            proportionate to the claimant’s detriment. This may include granting
            a beneficial interest, such as partial or full ownership.

            A resulting trust may arise when someone contributes to the purchase
            or improvement of property without being named on the title. The law
            presumes that the contributor did not intend to make a gift, giving
            rise to a beneficial interest equal to their contribution.
          </Typography>

            The legal test focuses on two aspects:
          </Typography>
          <ul style={{ marginLeft: "30px", color: "#00000080" }}>
            <li>

              >
                Contribution – Direct financial payments towards acquisition or
                significant improvement costs.
              </Typography>

              >
                Intention – The absence of an intention to gift the
                contribution, often inferred in family arrangements where no
                payment terms were documented.
              </Typography>

            In our client’s situation her tens of thousands of pounds spent on
            improving the property supported a resulting trust claim. At the
            very least her contribution would secure her an interest
            proportional to her investment relative to the overall value.

                Settlement – Our client achieved 100 per cent ownership of the
                property while paying only a fraction of the initially demanded
                £300,000.

                Understand Remedies – Proprietary estoppel and resulting trusts
                offer different routes to beneficial interest. Proprietary
                estoppel tends to provide broader remedies where
                unconscionability is clear.
